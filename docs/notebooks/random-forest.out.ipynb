    "\n",
    "Random forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. This method is particularly effective for classification problems, such as the one we are dealing with in the Thyroid dataset where the target variable is categorical. Each decision tree in a random forest splits the predictor space into distinct regions using recursive binary splits. For instance, a tree might first split based on whether $\\text{Age}<35$ and then further split based on whether $\\text{Gender}=\\text{Female}$ to predict cancer recurrence. These splits are chosen to minimize a specific error criterion, such as the Gini index or entropy \\[@james2021\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant limitation of individual decision trees is their high variance; small changes in the training data can lead to very different tree structures. Random forest addresses this by using bagging, where multiple trees are trained on different bootstrap samples of the data. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees, typically through majority voting in classification problems. This process reduces variance because the average of many uncorrelated trees’ predictions is less variable than the prediction of a single tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest further reduces correlation between trees by selecting a random subset of predictors to consider for each split, rather than considering all predictors. Typically, for classification problems, this subset size is approximately $\\sqrt{p}$, where $p$ is the total number of predictors. This random selection of features ensures that the trees are less similar to each other, which reduces the correlation between their predictions and leads to a greater reduction in variance. By combining bagging with feature randomness, random forests create robust models that are less prone to overfitting and provide better generalization to new data.\n",
